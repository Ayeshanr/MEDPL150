    <p>Image A: When I was walking around Hunter trying to capture some images, I was looking out from the third floor skybridge and noticed the bright yellow taxis below. What caught my attention was the strong contrast between the taxis and the darker street, especially against the white snow. I liked this image because there were so many unique elements to the image. There were cars, pedestrians, and branches, which added depth and made the photo feel active and alive. This image captures the fast pace of New York city, while still feeling structured and intentional from above.
