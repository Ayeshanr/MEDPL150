    <p>Image B: I chose this image because I was drawn to how the light was hitting the stone and creating strong shadows. The repeated shapes on the building makes the composition feel structured, but the pigeon breaks that pattern in a subtle way. I liked how the bird becomes the focus without overpowering the architecture around it. The sunlight brings out the texture in the stone and adds depth to the image. Overall, the balance between repetition and a single subject makes the photo feel calm but still visually interesting.
