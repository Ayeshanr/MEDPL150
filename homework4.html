    <p>In this photomontage, I explore how social media shifts our focus from living experiences to performing them for validation. The real landscape in the background is softened and slightly blurred, while the version displayed on the phone screen appears sharper and more vibrant. This contrast suggests how people often prioritize capturing and enhancing moments for online approval rather than fully experiencing them in real life. The floating notification icons represent likes and engagement, symbolizing the pressure to seek validation. Together, these elements comment on how social media transforms authentic experiences into curated performances designed for an audience.
