    <p>In this photomontage, I explore how social media shifts our focus from living experiences to performing them for validation. The real landscape in the background is softened and slightly blurred, while the version displayed on the phone screen appears sharper and more vibrant. This contrast suggests how people often prioritize capturing and enhancing moments for online approval rather than fully experiencing them in real life. The floating notification icons represent likes and engagement, symbolizing the pressure to seek validation. Together, these elements comment on how social media transforms authentic experiences into curated performances designed for an audience.
    <p> To create this photomontage, I combined multiple images, including a travel landscape, a phone image, and social media notification icons. I used a clipping mask to insert the landscape into the phone screen. I also added adjustment layers to brighten and increase contrast inside the phone screen so it appears more idealized than the surrounding environment. I added Gaussian Blur to the background to create depth and emphasize the phone as the focal point. I then used the blending modes to remove the white background and integrate them naturally into the composition. All edits were completed using layers and masks. I used multiple Photoshop tutorials throughout the process to complete this assignment.
